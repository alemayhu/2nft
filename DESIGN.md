# Design

2nft consists of three parts. The user facing part is a [Angular][a]
application. The Angular app communicates with a server running a small HTTP
API. The couple of HTTP methods implemented are described below.  If you are not
familiar with JavaScript, the server component here is a [Node.js][n]
application. The server has three dependencies express, body-parser and nodeman.
The two former ones are used when running the server but the last one is only
meant for local development. The exact versions are available in the
[package.json](./package.json).



## API

The server consists of three GET and one POST methods.

- GET  `/version` - uses git to find iptables revision.
- GET  `/help` - runs `iptables-translate --help`
- GET  `/werbinich` runs `whoami`
- POST `/translate` - runs `iptables-translate <input>`

As you might have guessed, the third part is forwarding all the rules to
[iptables-translate][i].  The server uses a child process to execute to
`iptables-translate` with the POSTed values. Some input sanitizing is applied to
prevent the user from abusing the system.
